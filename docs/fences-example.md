# Goldmark-Fences

## Overview

[Goldmark](github.com/yuin/goldmark) is a fast markdown renderer for Go. Fences are a markdown extension that allows you to wrap parts of a markdown in a `<div>` or other html-tag with custom classes, ids or other html attributes.

Fences are also called "fenced divs" or "fenced containers." I will use fences because it's the shortest of the available options.

Compare with Admonitions that are described in [[README]]

### An Example

```markdown
:::{.blue}
## Life Inside Fences

We are now inside a div with the css-class "blue". This can be used to style this block

:::{#insideme .red data="important"}
fences can be nested and given ids as well as classes
:::
:::
```

Now add the css to your stylesheet:

```css
.blue { background-color: steelblue; padding: 5px; }
#insideme { color: yellow; }
.red { background-color: red; }
```

And the fenced part will look like this:

:::{.blue}
## Life Inside Fences

We are now inside a div with the css-class "blue". This can be used to style this block

:::{#insideme .red data="important"}
fences can be nested and given ids as well as classes
:::

There should be no limits on the content:

```
code
```

> blockquotes

## Possible Use Cases

You can use fences to e.g.

* style your output
* wrap semantic units into blocks - e.g. put your toc into one div - which allows you to...
* move parts outside the normal layout - e.g. create a floating toc on the left
* fulfill the requirements of third party libs regarding attributes like `data=` etc.
* use it for other extensions -- e.g. to wrap all sections in divs for a semantic output structure
* create random html creations
